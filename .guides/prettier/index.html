  <h1>A Poem</h1>
  <h2>First Verse</h2>
  <p>Mary had a little lamb,</p>
  <p>His fleece was white as snow,</p>
  <p>And everywhere that Mary went,</p>
  <p>The lamb was sure to go.</p>  
  
  <h2>Second Verse</h2>
  <p>He followed her to school one day,</p>
  <p>Which was against the rule,</p>
  <p>It made the children laugh and play</p>
  <p>To see a lamb at school.</p>
  
  <h2>Third Verse</h2>
  <p>And so the teacher turned it out,</p>
  <p>But still it lingered near,</p>
  <p>And waited patiently about,</p>
  <p>Till Mary did appear.</p>
